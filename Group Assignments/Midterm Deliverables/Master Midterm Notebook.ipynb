    "Since its inception in the 1930s, redlining has impacted the quality of life for communities across the country. By labeling certain neighborhoods as “hazardous” and deeming them as less than, the HOLC's historic redlining maps enabled decades of discrimination, disinvestment, and neglect of primarily non-white and low-income communities. Today, the impacts of this practice continue to be seen and felt in cities all over, and San Francisco is no exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "While redlining has gained increasing prominence in U.S. housing discourse, its lasting implications go far beyond home ownership and intergenerational wealth. Accordingly, our final project examines the relationship between historic redlining practices and current health disparities within the context of San Francisco. Specifically, we examine the correlation between the areas that were deemed as “hazardous” on the HOLC maps, and the potentially negative health outcomes that are experienced in those areas today, including asthma rates and COVID-related deaths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our research will be guided by the larger question: is there a relationship between historically redlined areas in San Francisco and current health disparities in the city? Further, how does redlining intersect within current issues around environmental injustice and health inequity?"
