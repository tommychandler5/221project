    "Since its inception in the 1930s, redlining has shaped the built environment of cities across the country. With color-coded maps and a grading system that ranked neighborhoods according to risk, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) institutionalized a system of discrimination and disinvestment that primarily targeted low-income communities of color. Today, the lasting impacts of this practice continue to be felt in over 200 U.S. cities and towns, and San Francisco is no exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, redlining has gained increasing prominence in local housing discourse – but the lasting implications of this practice go far beyond home ownership and intergenerational wealth. Our final project accordingly examines the relationship between historic redlining practices and current health disparities in San Francisco. We assess this relationship by contextualizing redlined areas in relation to the health outcomes experienced in those neighborhoods today. We additionally conducted research into land use trends and zoning, built a comprehensive health index and analyzed access to healthcare in neighborhoods across San Francisco. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a greater sense, our research has been guided by the following questions: is there a relationship between historically redlined areas and current health disparities in San Francisco? What can redlining practices from the 1930s reveal about current issues of environmental injustice and health inequity? What are the implications of these findings for future policies and planning decisions? "
