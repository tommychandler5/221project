    "Since its inception in the 1930s, redlining has dictated the quality of life for communities across the country. By labeling certain neighborhoods as “hazardous” and grading them accordingly, the HOLC's infamous redlining maps enabled decades of discrimination, disinvestment, and neglect of primarily non-white and low-income communities. Today, the impacts of this practice continue to be seen and felt in many cities, and San Francisco is no exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "While redlining has gained increasing prominence in U.S. housing discourse, its lasting implications go far beyond home ownership and intergenerational wealth. Accordingly, our final project seeks to examine the relationship between historic redlining practices and current health disparities within the context of San Francisco. Specifically, we will examine any correlations between the areas that were previously deemed as “hazardous” on the HOLC maps and the potentially negative health outcomes that are experienced in those areas today. To do so, we'll investigate land use trends, build a comprehensive health index, assess COVID-19 rates, and analyze access to health care in neighborhoods across San Francisco.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a greater sense, our research will be guided by the larger question: is there a relationship between historically redlined areas and current health disparities in San Francisco? Further, how does redlining intersect with current of environmental injustice and health inequity?"
