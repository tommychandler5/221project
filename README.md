### Introduction
Since its inception in the 1930s, the practice of redlining has dictated the quality of life in communities across the country. By labeling certain neighborhoods as “hazardous” and deeming them as less than, redlining maps enabled decades of discrimination, disinvestment, and neglect of primarily non-white communities. Today, the impact of redlining continues to be seen and felt in many U.S. cities – and San Francisco is no exception. 
For our final project, we plan to examine the relationship between historic redlining practices and current health disparities. Specifically, we want to examine the correlation between the areas that were deemed as “hazardous” and the potentially negative health outcomes experienced in those areas today. We will start by looking at asthma rates by census tract, and pose the larger research question: is there a relationship between historically redlined areas in San Francisco and current asthma rates? Further, how has such redlining impacted access to healthcare and hospitals in those areas today? 

If we have the data and capacity, we will also contextualize these health outcomes and potential disparities within the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Given that asthma has been linked to more severe cases of COVID-19, we believe that examining and comparing the rates of COVID deaths across census tracts is another critical health outcome to study in relation to redlining and environmental injustice.   

### Explanation of Importance
This project is important because it has the potential to illuminate environmental and health equity issues in San Francisco that are linked to the lasting effects of redlining. Without question, communities across the country still feel the effects of historic redlining, and this project will allow us to actually visualize some of the consequences associated with this history.

COVID-19 ignited important conversations around the health inequities and injustices that many communities have faced for decades. This project will draw from and contribute to the data and research that has come out of the pandemic by identifying which communities are most vulnerable to diseases, like COVID-19. There will be new health challenges and pandemics in the future, so it is crucial to understand which communities may be most at risk. As planners, it is also vital that we understand how the fields of urban planning and public health can work together to mitigate those negative impacts.  

### Description of Spatial Scope
Our data will focus on the city and county of San Francisco, broken down by census tracts. We will remove the census tract that comprises the Farallon Islands from our spatial scope, due to its lack of permanent residents. We are also considering the possibility of comparing our findings in San Francisco with other cities – depending on data availability and individual bandwidth.

### Description of Data Sources
For our project, we intend to use the following data and sources: 
* Historic redlining map for San Francisco from Mapping Inequality 
* Asthma percentiles and emergency department visits (by census tract) from CalEnviroScreening
* This map/data also includes the location of all hospitals with emergency departments
* COVID deaths by geographic location from DataSF
* Relevant SF census data pulled from Social Explorer 
* Any other data that we find that provides necessary context to the lasting implications of redlining on health disparities and access to care

### Conclusion 
We believe that neighborhoods in the southeast corner of San Francisco are likely the most at risk of experiencing a disproportionately high number of asthma-related emergencies. We hypothesize that this is a result of the decades of discrimination, disinvestment, and neglect that are tied to redlining and racism in the Bay Area and beyond. We plan to explore this data through an environmental justice framework. 
Ultimately, our goal is to visualize and layer the asthma rates (by census tract) onto the redlined areas of San Francisco – and then analyze the relationship between negative health outcomes and historic redlining practices. Additionally, we intend to overlay data about access to healthcare and hospitals to provide deeper insight into the lasting effects of redlining on health inequities and environmental injustice.
